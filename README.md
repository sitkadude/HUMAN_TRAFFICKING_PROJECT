# codeLOU_python
Project for Code Louisville Python Course Spring 2019. 

In this project, I collected global data on human trafficking. My goal in this project was to answer the question "HOW MANY people are victims of human trafficking across the globe? WHO are they? WHY are they being trafficked? And WHERE are they 
being trafficked?" I collected my data set from Ctdatacollaborative.org which is the single most comprehensive and accurate global dataset about human trafficking victims in the world. This dataset was taken from September 2018, making it very recent in data reportings. Being that there are many places in the world where human trafficking is not reported and/or have no wyas or means to report, these numbers are far from actual. Yet, any data in this field is helpful data to help fight against largest form of slavery today, human trafficking.
