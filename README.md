# HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROJECT

In this project, I collected global data on human trafficking. My goal in this project was to answer the question "HOW MANY people are victims of human trafficking across the globe among documented database cases? WHO are they? WHY are they being trafficked? And WHERE are they being trafficked?" My wife and I spent a year in SE Asia working with human trafficking victims, becoming very involved and up to date on the current state of global human trafficking. I collected my data set from Ctdatacollaborative.org which is the single most comprehensive and accurate global dataset about human trafficking victims in the world. This dataset was taken from September 2018, making it a very recent dataset among documented database cases. Being that there are many places in the world where human trafficking is not reported and/or have no ways or means to report, these numbers are far below the actual. Yet, any data in this field is helpful data to help fight against the largest form of modern day slavery today--human trafficking.

I visualized my results using Seaborn.
